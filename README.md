# Atmega 8 Programming Workshop

This repository contains the code and simulation screenshots for the Atmega 8 Programming Workshop.

## Programs

1. **LED with button** (`led_blinking.hex`):
   Description: This program makes an LED blink with interrupt from button.
   - `led Button.txt`: Source code in C language.
   - `led Button.hex`: Compiled hex file for Atmega 8.

2. **H Bridge** (`button_led.hex`):
   Description: Motor direction control using atmega
   - `H bridge atmega8.txt`: Source code in C language.
   - `H bridge atmega8.hex`: Compiled hex file for Atmega 8.

3. **LED Matrix 5X&** (`adc_led_brightness.hex`):
   Description: This program alternatively turns columns of LED Array On and Off.
   - `LED Matrix.c`: Source code in C language.
   - `LED Matrix.hex`: Compiled hex file for Atmega 8.

## Simulation Screenshots

The `simulation_screenshots` folder contains screenshots of the Proteus simulations for each program.

## Ignore File

The `.gitignore` file is included to exclude unnecessary files (e.g., intermediate compilation files) from version control.

## Usage

To run the programs on the Atmega 8 microcontroller, you can use any suitable programmer and the provided hex files.

To simulate the programs, use Proteus or any other supported simulator and refer to the simulation screenshots in the `simulation_screenshots` folder.

## Contributing

If you find any issues or want to contribute to the project, feel free to submit pull requests or open issues.
